# Emotion Mapping System for Music Listening

This project is a web-based software tool developed for the **Psychology Department at Samsun University**. It enables emotional mapping based on user interaction with a coordinate system while listening to music. The application helps analyze how users emotionally respond to different parts of a song in real time.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The aim of this project is to support psychological research by providing a tool to:

- Monitor and analyze user emotional responses (e.g., sadness, joy, excitement, fear) during music listening.
- Allow users to click on an emotional coordinate map at any moment while the song is playing.
- Export collected emotional data (click time, coordinates, username) to an Excel file for further analysis.

This system can be used in emotion research, cognitive psychology studies, and music therapy evaluations.

## üéµ How It Works

1. A user listens to a predefined song within the application.
2. During playback, the user clicks on a 2D coordinate grid that represents emotional states.
3. Each click is recorded with:
   - **Timestamp (minute:second)**
   - **X and Y coordinates on the emotion map**
   - **Username**
4. All collected data can be exported as an Excel (.xlsx) file for analysis.

## üß† Key Features

- Real-time emotional input through a visual coordinate grid
- Synchronized with music playback
